This repository holds the source code for percolator and format
converters software packages; a software for postprocessing of shotgun
proteomics data.

While the source code is hosted at github, the binary downloads are
now days hosted on sourceforge:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/percolator/files

The building procedure is cmake-based. Helper scripts for building on
different platforms can be found in: admin/bilders/

The cleanest way to build is to use the vagrant virtual machine
system, which can be setup using the script: admin/vagrant/manager.sh
